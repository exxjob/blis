	// duplication within the logic that packs micropanels from triangular
	// matrices would be ugly, and so we simply don't support it. As a

	// matrix to be on the left (and thus the general matrix to the on the
	// right). So our solution is that in those cases, the subconfigurations
	// simply #define BLIS_DISABLE_TRMM_RIGHT.

	// On dual-socket architectures, disabling trmm right is needed for a

	// left-side operation allows for dramatically improved performance due to
	// independent parallelization on the two sockets.
